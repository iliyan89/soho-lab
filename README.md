# Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) lab


## Objective

This Small Office/Home Office project was build from scratch and is designed to serve three separate LANs in one entity. It is created using Cisco's Packet Tracer and is fully operational.
Since I am still on my path to the CCNA 200-301 v1.1, I used a YouTube video as a referrence to guide me.
This project helped me a lot in understanding CCNA concepts and makes the further learning process easier and more clear.
